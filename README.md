🚖 **Hypothesis Testing for Fare Payment Impact in Taxi Services**:
This project investigates the impact of payment methods (cash vs credit card) on taxi fare amounts using hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics. The goal was to identify potential revenue optimization strategies for taxi service providers based on passenger tipping behavior and fare patterns.

📌 **Project Summary**
📈 Analyzed fare distributions across different payment methods using Python.

🔍 Discovered that credit card transactions tend to have higher average fares, largely influenced by tipping behavior.

🧪 Applied statistical testing to determine if the difference in fare means was statistically significant.

📊 Provided insights into how payment methods can influence revenue strategies in transportation services.

🧪 Statistical Approach
Data Preprocessing

Cleaned fare and payment method data.

Removed outliers and ensured consistent formatting.

Descriptive Analysis

Compared mean, median, and standard deviation of fares by payment type.

Visualized distribution with boxplots and histograms.

**Hypothesis Testing**

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in fare means between cash and credit card payments.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Credit card payments have higher fare means due to tipping.

Used two-sample t-tests for comparison.

**Findings**

Results showed statistically significant differences in fare amounts.

Credit card transactions were associated with higher average fares (assumed to be ~15% higher, supported by descriptive evidence).

Tip amounts were a major contributing factor.
